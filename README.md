# 💬 WA Directly

**Chat on WhatsApp Without Saving Contacts.**

Ever wanted to message a new number but dreaded the hassle of saving it first? WA Directly is your solution! Chat instantly, no drama.

## 🛑 The Problem

Want to chat with a new WhatsApp number? You have to:
1. Open contacts
2. Add new contact
3. Give it a name (even for a one-time chat)
4. Then finally chat

Annoying? Absolutely. Your contacts end up filled with "Delivery Guy", "Random Shop", "That Courier" 😅

No saving, no hassle. The number opens directly in WhatsApp.
